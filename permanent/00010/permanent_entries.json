I built Agora as a side-project leading up to the holiday season. I wanted to find an easier way to find Christmas gifts, without needing to go store-by-store.<p>My wife asked me for a a pair of red shoes for Christmas. I quickly typed it into Google and found a combination of ads from large retailers and links to a 1948 movie called 'Red Shoes'. I decided to build Agora to solve my own problem (and stay happily married). The product is a search engine that automatically crawls thousands of Shopify stores and makes them easily accessible with a search interface. There's a few additional features to enhance the buying experience including saving products, filters, reviews, and popular products.<p>I've started with exclusively Shopify stores and plan to expand the crawler to other e-commerce platforms like BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Wix, etc. The technical challenge I've found is keeping the search speed and performance strong as the data set becomes larger.
