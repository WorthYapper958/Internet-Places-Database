When I didn't find any existing editors, I developed a Swara Notebook, a mobile focused web app to write North Indian Classical (<i>Hindustani</i>) music notations.<p>The notes (called <i>Sargam</i>, similar to Solfege) can be written in English, Devnagri and Bangla scripts. The transcribed song can be played back in 6 different rhythmic cycles (<i>Taal</i>) to the accompaniment of the <i>Tabla</i>(a type of drum) or a metronome. Here's an example of a transcribed song <a href=\"https://swaranotebook.com/view/vlB9hVgb5OdKcadbhOOYyzKwvpl2/53219a9192a5-Piyarava-ab-tum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://swaranotebook.com/view/vlB9hVgb5OdKcadbhOOYyzKwvpl2/...</a><p>Since North Indian classical music is oriented around <i>Ragas</i> (similar to modes in western classical music), the keyboard adapts to the notes of a <i>Raga</i>, making it contextually easier to key in notes.<", "link": "https://swaranotebook.com", "dead": false, "source_obj__id": 1, "permanent": true, "age": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 0, "title": "Show HN: SwaraNotebook \u2013 a notation editor for Indian classical music", "source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "date_published": "2023-11-28T02:34:00+00:00", "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "page_rating_contents": 0, "artist": "Hacker News: Front Page", "user": null, "language": "en"}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "thumbnail": null, "album": null, "vote": 0, "description": null, "link": "https://www.sweethome3d.com", "dead": false, "permanent": true, "age": null, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating": 20, "title": "Sweet Home 3D - Draw floor plans and arrange furniture freely", "source": "", "date_published": "2023-10-25T17:20:18.110245+00:00", "comments": [], "bookmarked": false, "tags": [], "page_rating_contents": 20, "artist": null, "user": null, "language": null}, {"page_rating_visits": 0, "thumbnail": "https://media.sweetwater.com/m/logo/sweetwater-tagline-1200x630.jpg?optimize=medium&auto=webp", "album": null, "vote": 0, "description": "Sweetwater is one of the largest pro audio dealers in the world, offering a huge selection of music instruments and audio gear.
