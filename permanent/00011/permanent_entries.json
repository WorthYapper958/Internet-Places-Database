When I didn't find any existing editors, I developed a Swara Notebook, a mobile focused web app to write North Indian Classical (<i>Hindustani</i>) music notations.<p>The notes (called <i>Sargam</i>, similar to Solfege) can be written in English, Devnagri and Bangla scripts. The transcribed song can be played back in 6 different rhythmic cycles (<i>Taal</i>) to the accompaniment of the <i>Tabla</i>(a type of drum) or a metronome. Here's an example of a transcribed song <a href=\"https://swaranotebook.com/view/vlB9hVgb5OdKcadbhOOYyzKwvpl2/53219a9192a5-Piyarava-ab-tum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://swaranotebook.com/view/vlB9hVgb5OdKcadbhOOYyzKwvpl2/...</a><p>Since North Indian classical music is oriented around <i>Ragas</i> (similar to modes in western classical music), the keyboard adapts to the notes of a <i>Raga</i>, making it contextually easier to key in notes.<", "bookmarked": false, "title": "Show HN: SwaraNotebook \u2013 a notation editor for Indian classical music", "page_rating": 0, "language": "en", "date_published": "2023-11-28T02:34:00+00:00", "permanent": true, "page_rating_visits": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "tags": [], "age": null, "comments": []}, {"page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": null, "source": "", "album": null, "artist": null, "user": null, "link": "https://www.sweethome3d.com", "page_rating_contents": 20, "description": null, "bookmarked": false, "title": "Sweet Home 3D - Draw floor plans and arrange furniture freely", "page_rating": 20, "language": null, "date_published": "2023-10-25T17:20:18.110245+00:00", "permanent": true, "page_rating_visits": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "tags": [], "age": null, "comments": []}, {"page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": null, "source": "", "album": null, "artist": null, "user": null, "link": "https://www.sweetsunnysouth.com", "page_rating_contents": 0, "description": null, "bookmarked": false, "title": null, "page_rating": 0, "language": null, "date_published": "2024-02-08T16:44:00.099729+00:00", "permanent": true, "page_rating_visits": 0, "dead": false, "vote": 0, "tags": [], "age": null, "comments": []}, {"page_rating_votes": 0, "thumbnail": "https://www.swiftpublisher.com/assets/img/og_img/fb-sp-overview.jpg", "source": "https://www.swiftpublisher.com", "album": "https://www.swiftpublisher.com", "artist": "https://www.swiftpublisher.com", "user": null, "link": "https://www.swiftpublisher.com", "page_rating_contents": 52, "description": "Swift Publisher is an easy publishing and page layout application for Mac.
